# Mobile first blog theme for Hugo 

It was created for my personal blog at [stou.dk](http://stou.dk)

The theme is built using Zurb Foundation.
Thus there are a few requirements to get started.

## Example

You can see an [example of the theme in action](http://stou.dk).


## How to Use the Theme

If you have the requirements installed, you can get started like this

- Clone this repo in the themes folder of your Hugo site
- `cd themes/stou-dk-theme`
- `bower install`
- `bundle exec compass watch`

Leave the last command running and run the hugo server in a different terminal.
This will allow you to see the updates to you style changes using hugo's liveupdate.

# Zurb Foundation with s Little More Details

The easiest way to get started with Foundation + Compass.

## Requirements

  * Ruby 1.9+
  * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
  * [compass](http://compass-style.org/): `gem install compass`
  * [bower](http://bower.io): `npm install bower -g`

## Quickstart

  * [Download this starter compass project and unzip it](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-compass-template/archive/master.zip)
  * Run `bower install` to install the latest version of Foundation
  
Then when you're working on your project, just run the following command:

bundle exec compass watch
```

## Upgrading

If you'd like to upgrade to a newer version of Foundation down the road just run:

```bash
bower update
```
